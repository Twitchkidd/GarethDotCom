Heya! Haven't cooked up a Gatsby site in a while, time to do so again.

I'm just going to read the code already present and take notes ...

The npm script 'write-good' references a folder not currently present.

Oh, right, you can start from just cmd + space in graphicool to explore.

Okay editing the config files should be a later thing.

Okay I'm pretty sure I don't know why /content/ is being pinged for it's .md files, that's okay for now
